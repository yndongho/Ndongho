Script Kiddies:
Motivation: Script kiddies are typically inexperienced and immature individuals who engage in hacking activities for thrill and notoriety rather than financial gain or political reasons. They are often motivated by curiosity or a desire to prove their technical prowess to their peers.
Tactics: Script kiddies lack advanced hacking skills, so they rely on pre-written scripts and tools readily available on the internet to launch attacks. They may perform activities like DDoS attacks, defacement of websites, or basic scanning and exploitation of vulnerabilities in poorly secured systems.
Examples: In 2000, the "Mafiaboy" (Michael Calce) launched a series of DDoS attacks against major websites, including Yahoo, eBay, and Amazon, causing widespread disruption. His motivations were to impress friends and gain notoriety rather than any specific financial or political agenda.

Hacktivists:
Motivation: Hacktivists are politically or socially motivated individuals or groups who use hacking as a means to further their causes, protest, or raise awareness on issues they are passionate about. Their actions are driven by ideological or moral beliefs.
Tactics: Hacktivists employ various techniques such as website defacement, data breaches, and DDoS attacks to disrupt or expose their targets. They may target government websites, corporations, or organizations they believe are acting against their ideologies.
Examples: Anonymous is a well-known hacktivist collective that has been involved in numerous cyber-attacks, including Operation Payback against organizations opposing WikiLeaks and Operation Tunisia during the Arab Spring, where they targeted Tunisian government websites to support the revolution.

Cybercriminals:
Motivation: Cybercriminals are motivated primarily by financial gain. They seek to steal sensitive information, such as personal data, credit card details, or intellectual property, which they can sell on the dark web or use for fraudulent activities like identity theft, ransomware attacks, or phishing schemes.
Tactics: Cybercriminals use a wide range of tactics, including malware distribution, phishing emails, exploiting software vulnerabilities, and ransomware attacks. They often operate with a profit-driven mindset and are skilled in money-making schemes.
Examples: The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, encrypted files on computers worldwide and demanded a ransom for decryption. Cybercriminals behind the attack were motivated by financial gain, seeking payments in Bitcoin from affected victims.
